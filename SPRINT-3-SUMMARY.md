## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation Details

### BaNCS Webhook Integration
```javascript
// Real-time webhook processing with security
verifyWebhookSignature(req) {
  const body = req.rawBody || Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(req.body));
  const expectedSignature = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', this.config.webhookSecret)
    .update(body)
    .digest('hex');
  
  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(
    Buffer.from(expectedSignature, 'hex'),
    Buffer.from(providedSignature, 'hex')
  );
}
```

### CBDC Operations
```javascript
// Central bank privilege verification
async processMintTransaction(transaction) {
  if (!this.isCentralBankAccount()) {
    throw new Error('Only central bank can mint CBDC');
  }
  
  // Create Algorand asset configuration transaction
  const mintTxn = algosdk.makeAssetConfigTxnWithSuggestedParamsFromObject({
    from: this.account.addr,
    total: transaction.amount * Math.pow(10, CBDC_ASSET_PARAMS.decimals),
    assetName: CBDC_ASSET_PARAMS.assetName,
    unitName: CBDC_ASSET_PARAMS.unitName,
    suggestedParams: txnParams
  });
}
```

### Real-time Analytics
```javascript
// Comprehensive dashboard data generation
getDashboardData(timeWindow = TIME_WINDOWS.LAST_24_HOURS) {
  return {
    transactionOverview: this.getTransactionOverview(timeRange),
    performanceMetrics: this.getPerformanceMetrics(timeRange),
    networkDistribution: this.getNetworkDistribution(timeRange),
    complianceMetrics: this.getComplianceMetrics(timeRange),
    cbdcMetrics: this.getCBDCMetrics(timeRange),
    realTimeMetrics: this.getRealTimeMetrics(),
    errorAnalysis: this.getErrorAnalysis(timeRange),
    geographicDistribution: this.getGeographicDistribution(timeRange)
  };
}
```
